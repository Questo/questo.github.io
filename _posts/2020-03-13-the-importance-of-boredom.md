title: The importance of boredom
---

**When was the last time you allowed yourself to be bored?**
  
I think most of us feel that boredom is something to loathe, and to be avoided at all times.
That's why we constantly reach for some sort of stimuli, like our phones, videogames or watching crap television - anything we can do to not be alone with our thoughts.

I wanna be clear, I'm not making a case that checking up on social media, playing the latest triple A videogame or binge watch the latest season of your favourite show on Netflix is a bad thing.
My case is rather that must realize that it is okay to be bored, to have nothing to do, that boredom can make us more productive and that it can make us happy (sometimes).

It is when we are bored, when we aren't being subjected to constant stimuli, that we allow our minds to wander aimlessly. When this happens, I think we naturally being to contemplate and reflect (we have nothing better to do, right?). Several studies have shown that boredom sparks creativity and can be good for your mental health, one such study is [Why Being Bored Might Not Be a Bad Thing after All](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2017.0033).

Speaking from my own personal experience, it is when I am bored that I actually get stuff done that I would otherwise push aside in favour of some passive activity which my only purpose for doing is to neutralize my boredom. Like cleaning my home, playing my guitar or plan software projects that I know I will never finish.

This very website is a result of me being bored. It got me to start researching static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which I used to build this site. 

Maybe you're reading this post whilst being bored? Hopefully you found the content interesting and you became less bored than you already were, or maybe you've become even more bored after getting to this last paragraph. 

Anyways, you are welcome.
