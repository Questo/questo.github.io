title: "Book Review: Invisible monsters"
---

I borrowed this book from my relative after a visit and once I got home and began reading it I just couldn't put it down, it was very captivating in it's story-telling and the style of it's writing.

Invisible Monsters was originally supposed to be the first novel published by author Chuck Palahniuk. But apparently the publisher thought the contents of the book was too disturbing for the readers of the o-so-colourful 90s. But after the huge success of Palahniuk's other book, **Fight Club**, the publishers gave this book another shot and it was finally published in paperback form in 1999, three years after Fight Club.

The story is told from the perspective of a nameless narrator, a fashion model who after a mysterious gunshot injury / car accident looses her entire lower jaw. Whilst in the hospital recovering,  she meets the queen supreme "herself", Brandy Alexander, who together with another companion teaches the narrator how to reinvent herself.

The narrative jumps around all the time, which took me a few chapters to get into. It got me quite annoyed at first as I found it very hard to figure out what was going on as all we get are scattered anecdotes. However, after a few chapters I got past this and accepted I wasn't going to get a linear story. Having accepted this I really started to enjoy the book, one page taking place at a photo shoot with the narrator and her best friend posing at a junkyard, and a few pages later being transported to a open house viewing where the characters are stealing prescription drugs to sell, taking quick stops at the Canadian border, a very awkward Christmas dinner, a house inferno, and the home of the three male drag queens known as "The Rhea Sisters", patrons of Brandy Alexander who's paying for all her surgeries to become a woman.

I found Chuck Palahniuk's style of writing to be very sarcastic, and a bit nihilistic. [A label that Palahniuk has rejected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk#Reception_and_criticism), stating that he is a romantic, and that his works is often mistaken because they express ideas that others do not believe in.

If I were to summarize what the book is about into a single word, I'd say **change**. Every character in this story wants to change out of what they are, some for very destructive reasons, and others for less so.

The book isn't that long, coming in shy of 300 pages but I'd say you could cut some of the later chapters down a bit as they don't really offer anything new to the story, other than underlining notions that have already been brought up not only once, but many times. The book is also quite heavy on "twists" once you are coming up to the end, one or two could've been enough - but it get's quite excessive.

**A highly recommended book!**
