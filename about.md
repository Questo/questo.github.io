![Mathias]({{ site.url }}/public/images/mathias-smol.jpg)

I was born in April 1991 in Sweden into a pretty standard nuclear family. My two year older sister and I grew up in an industrial community just by the highway very close to the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jönköping" target="__blank">Jönköping</a> in the province of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/småland" target="__blank">Småland.</a>

I have always been interested in computers from a very early age, I have a strong memory of when my father loaned a MS-DOS computer from our cousins, and since that that I became enchanted.
